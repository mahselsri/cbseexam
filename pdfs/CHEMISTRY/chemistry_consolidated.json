Amines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, \namides, etc. They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influences their \nphysical properties. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger bases than \nammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing \ngroups, respectively increase and decrease their basic character. \nReactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair of \nelectrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at \nnitrogen atom on the type of reactions and nature of products is \nresponsible for identification and distinction between primary, secondary \nand tertiary amines.

For a general \nreaction aA + bB  C with no intermediate steps in its reaction \nmechanism, meaning that it is an elementary reaction, the rate law is \ngiven by  r = k[A]x[B]y, where [A] and [B] express the concentrations of A \nand B in moles per litre. Exponents x and y vary for each reaction and \nare determined experimentally. The value of k varies with conditions \nthat affect reaction rate, such as temperature, pressure, surface area, etc. \nThe sum of these exponents is known as overall reaction order. A zero \norder reaction has a constant rate that is independent of the \nconcentration of the reactants. A first order reaction depends on the \nconcentration of only one reactant. A reaction is said to be second order \nwhen the overall order is two. Once we have determined the order of the \nreaction, we can go back and plug in one set of our initial values and \nsolve for k.  \n(i) Calculate the overall order of a reaction which has the following \nrate expression : 1 \n Rate = k[A]1/2 [B]3/2   \n(ii) What is the effect of temperature on rate of reaction ? 1 \n(iii) What is meant by rate of a reaction ? 1 \n(iv) (a) A first order reaction takes 77\u00b778 minutes for 50% \ncompletion.

In alkyl amines, a combination of electron releasing, \nsteric and hydrogen bonding factors influence the stability of the \nsubstituted ammonium cations in protic polar solvents and thus affect \nthe basic nature of amines. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and \nwithdrawing groups, respectively increase and decrease their basic \ncharacter. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom \non the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for \nidentification and distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary \namines. Presence of amino group in aromatic ring enhances reactivity of \nthe aromatic amines. Aryl diazonium salts provide advantageous \nmethods for producing aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and arenes by \nreductive removal of the diazo group.   \n Answer the following questions :      \n (i) Arrange the following in the increasing order of their pK b values in \naqueous solution :   1  \n   C2H5NH2 ,   (C2H5)2NH,   (C2H5)3N \n(ii) Aniline on nitration gives a substantial amount of m-nitroaniline, \nthough amino group is o/p directing.

          "text": "Nucleophilic Substitution  \n Nucleophilic Substitution reaction of haloalkane can be conducted \naccording to both SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. SN1 is a two step reaction \nwhile SN2 is a single step reaction. For any haloalkane which mechanism \nis followed depends on factors such as structure of haloalkane, properties \nof leaving group, nucleophilic reagent and solvent.   \n Influences of solvent polarity : In SN1 reaction, the polarity of the system \nincreases from the reactant to the transition state, because a polar solvent \nhas a greater effect on the transition state than the reactant, thereby \nreducing activation energy and accelerating the reaction. In SN2 reaction, \nthe polarity of the system generally does not change from the reactant to \nthe transition state and only charge dispersion occurs. At this time, polar \nsolvent has a great stabilizing effect on Nu than the transition state, \nthereby increasing activation energy and slow down the reaction rate. For \nexample, the decomposition rate (SN1) of tertiary chlorobutane at 25 \uf0b0C in \nwater (dielectric constant 79) is 300000 times faster than in ethanol \n(dielectric constant 24). The reaction rate (SN2) of 2-Bromopropane and \nNaOH in ethanol containing 40% water is twice slower than in absolute \nethanol. Hence the level of solvent polarity has influence on both SN1 and \nSN2 reaction, but with different results. Generally speaking weak polar \nsolvent is favourable for SN2 reaction, while strong polar solvent is \nfavourable for SN1. Generally speaking the substitution reaction of \ntertiary haloalkane is based on SN1 mechanism in solvents with a strong \npolarity (for example ethanol containing water). \n56/5/1   18  \n \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue0d0\ue0ac\ue02a\ue03e\ue07c  \ue017\ue14a \ue00b\ue088\ue032 \ue028\ue040\ue03f\ue01e\ue011 :   \n (a) SN1 \ue030\ue07c \ue032\ue047\ue03f\ue03a\ue030\ue040\ue017\ue032\ue025 \ue08b\ue031\ue03e\ue07c  \ue03b\ue03e\ue047\ue026\ue03e \ue03b\ue048 ? 1 \n (b) \ue01e\ue034 \ue017\ue0bd \ue026\ue041\ue034\ue02a\ue03e \ue030\ue07c \ue011\ue027\ue047\ue02a\ue03e\ue045\ue034 \ue017\ue030 \ue118\ue041\ue037\ue040\ue031 \ue08b\ue031\ue03e\ue07c \ue03b\ue03e\ue047\ue026\ue03e \ue03b\ue048 ?  1 \n (c) \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue0d0\ue09a\ue031\ue047 \ue017 \ue031\ue041\ue019\ue034\ue03e\ue07c \ue030\ue07c \ue03a\ue047 \ue017\ue03e\ue048\ue02a SN2 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e \ue017\ue14a \ue0d0\ue03f\ue026 \ue007\ue03f\ue029\ue017 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue038\ue040\ue034 \ue03b\ue048  ?  \n  (i) CH3 \u2013 CH2 \u2013 I   \ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e   CH3CH2 \u2013 Cl \n  (ii) \n Cl   \ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e  \n CH2 \u2013 Cl  2 \uf0b4 1 \n\ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e \n (c) \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue017\ue03e\ue047  SN1 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue007\ue03e\ue07c \ue017\ue14a \ue0d0\ue03f\ue026 \ue00b\ue02a\ue017\ue0bd \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue038\ue040\ue034\ue026\ue03e \ue017\ue14a  \ue02e\ue058\ue026\ue047 \ue0c9\ue030 \ue030\ue07c \ue0ab\ue031\ue037\ue0a7\ue0ae\ue027\ue026 \n\ue017\ue0bd\ue03f\ue01e\ue011 : \n  (i) 2- \ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-2-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 1-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047\ue02c\ue047\ue09e\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047\ue02c\ue047\ue09e\ue021\ue047\ue02a \n  (ii) 1- \ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-3-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-2-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-3-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a 2 \uf0b4 1",

          "text": "Nucleophilic Substitution  \n Nucleophilic Substitution reaction of haloalkane can be conducted \naccording to both SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. SN1 is a two step reaction \nwhile SN2 is a single step reaction. For any haloalkane which mechanism \nis followed depends on factors such as structure of haloalkane, properties \nof leaving group, nucleophilic reagent and solvent.   \n Influences of solvent polarity : In SN1 reaction, the polarity of the system \nincreases from the reactant to the transition state, because a polar solvent \nhas a greater effect on the transition state than the reactant, thereby \nreducing activation energy and accelerating the reaction. In SN2 reaction, \nthe polarity of the system generally does not change from the reactant to \nthe transition state and only charge dispersion occurs. At this time, polar \nsolvent has a great stabilizing effect on Nu than the transition state, \nthereby increasing activation energy and slow down the reaction rate. For \nexample, the decomposition rate (SN1) of tertiary chlorobutane at 25 \uf0b0C in \nwater (dielectric constant 79) is 300000 times faster than in ethanol \n(dielectric constant 24). The reaction rate (SN2) of 2-Bromopropane and \nNaOH in ethanol containing 40% water is twice slower than in absolute \nethanol. Hence the level of solvent polarity has influence on both SN1 and \nSN2 reaction, but with different results. Generally speaking weak polar \nsolvent is favourable for SN2 reaction, while strong polar solvent is \nfavourable for SN1. Generally speaking the substitution reaction of \ntertiary haloalkane is based on SN1 mechanism in solvents with a strong \npolarity (for example ethanol containing water). \n56/5/2   20  \n \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue0d0\ue0ac\ue02a\ue03e\ue07c  \ue017\ue14a \ue00b\ue088\ue032 \ue028\ue040\ue03f\ue01e\ue011 :   \n (a) SN1 \ue030\ue07c \ue032\ue047\ue03f\ue03a\ue030\ue040\ue017\ue032\ue025 \ue08b\ue031\ue03e\ue07c  \ue03b\ue03e\ue047\ue026\ue03e \ue03b\ue048 ? 1 \n (b) \ue01e\ue034 \ue017\ue0bd \ue026\ue041\ue034\ue02a\ue03e \ue030\ue07c \ue011\ue027\ue047\ue02a\ue03e\ue045\ue034 \ue017\ue030 \ue118\ue041\ue037\ue040\ue031 \ue08b\ue031\ue03e\ue07c \ue03b\ue03e\ue047\ue026\ue03e \ue03b\ue048 ?  1 \n (c) \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue0d0\ue09a\ue031\ue047 \ue017 \ue031\ue041\ue019\ue034\ue03e\ue07c \ue030\ue07c \ue03a\ue047 \ue017\ue03e\ue048\ue02a SN2 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e \ue017\ue14a \ue0d0\ue03f\ue026 \ue007\ue03f\ue029\ue017 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue038\ue040\ue034 \ue03b\ue048  ?  \n  (i) CH3 \u2013 CH2 \u2013 I   \ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e   CH3CH2 \u2013 Cl \n  (ii) \n Cl   \ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e  \n CH2 \u2013 Cl  2 \uf0b4 1 \n\ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e \n (c) \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue017\ue03e\ue047  SN1 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue007\ue03e\ue07c \ue017\ue14a \ue0d0\ue03f\ue026 \ue00b\ue02a\ue017\ue0bd \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue038\ue040\ue034\ue026\ue03e \ue017\ue14a  \ue02e\ue058\ue026\ue047 \ue0c9\ue030 \ue030\ue07c \ue0ab\ue031\ue037\ue0a7\ue0ae\ue027\ue026 \n\ue017\ue0bd\ue03f\ue01e\ue011 : \n  (i) 2- \ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-2-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 1-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047\ue02c\ue047\ue09e\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047\ue02c\ue047\ue09e\ue021\ue047\ue02a \n  (ii) 1- \ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-3-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-2-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-3-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a 2 \uf0b4 1 \n\ue018\ue099\ue023 \u2013 \ue01b",

          "text": "Nucleophilic Substitution  \n Nucleophilic Substitution reaction of haloalkane can be conducted \naccording to both SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. SN1 is a two step reaction \nwhile SN2 is a single step reaction. For any haloalkane which mechanism \nis followed depends on factors such as structure of haloalkane, properties \nof leaving group, nucleophilic reagent and solvent.   \n Influences of solvent polarity : In SN1 reaction, the polarity of the system \nincreases from the reactant to the transition state, because a polar solvent \nhas a greater effect on the transition state than the reactant, thereby \nreducing activation energy and accelerating the reaction. In SN2 reaction, \nthe polarity of the system generally does not change from the reactant to \nthe transition state and only charge dispersion occurs. At this time, polar \nsolvent has a great stabilizing effect on Nu than the transition state, \nthereby increasing activation energy and slow down the reaction rate. For \nexample, the decomposition rate (SN1) of tertiary chlorobutane at 25 \uf0b0C in \nwater (dielectric constant 79) is 300000 times faster than in ethanol \n(dielectric constant 24). The reaction rate (SN2) of 2-Bromopropane and \nNaOH in ethanol containing 40% water is twice slower than in absolute \nethanol. Hence the level of solvent polarity has influence on both SN1 and \nSN2 reaction, but with different results. Generally speaking weak polar \nsolvent is favourable for SN2 reaction, while strong polar solvent is \nfavourable for SN1. Generally speaking the substitution reaction of \ntertiary haloalkane is based on SN1 mechanism in solvents with a strong \npolarity (for example ethanol containing water). \n56/5/3   18  \n \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue0d0\ue0ac\ue02a\ue03e\ue07c  \ue017\ue14a \ue00b\ue088\ue032 \ue028\ue040\ue03f\ue01e\ue011 :   \n (a) SN1 \ue030\ue07c \ue032\ue047\ue03f\ue03a\ue030\ue040\ue017\ue032\ue025 \ue08b\ue031\ue03e\ue07c  \ue03b\ue03e\ue047\ue026\ue03e \ue03b\ue048 ? 1 \n (b) \ue01e\ue034 \ue017\ue0bd \ue026\ue041\ue034\ue02a\ue03e \ue030\ue07c \ue011\ue027\ue047\ue02a\ue03e\ue045\ue034 \ue017\ue030 \ue118\ue041\ue037\ue040\ue031 \ue08b\ue031\ue03e\ue07c \ue03b\ue03e\ue047\ue026\ue03e \ue03b\ue048 ?  1 \n (c) \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue0d0\ue09a\ue031\ue047 \ue017 \ue031\ue041\ue019\ue034\ue03e\ue07c \ue030\ue07c \ue03a\ue047 \ue017\ue03e\ue048\ue02a SN2 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e \ue017\ue14a \ue0d0\ue03f\ue026 \ue007\ue03f\ue029\ue017 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue038\ue040\ue034 \ue03b\ue048  ?  \n  (i) CH3 \u2013 CH2 \u2013 I   \ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e   CH3CH2 \u2013 Cl \n  (ii) \n Cl   \ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e  \n CH2 \u2013 Cl  2 \uf0b4 1 \n\ue007\ue027\ue037\ue03e \n (c) \ue03f\ue02a\ue0a4\ue02a\ue03f\ue034\ue03f\ue018\ue026 \ue017\ue03e\ue047  SN1 \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue007\ue03e\ue07c \ue017\ue14a \ue0d0\ue03f\ue026 \ue00b\ue02a\ue017\ue0bd \ue007\ue03f\ue02f\ue03f\ue0c9\ue031\ue03e\ue038\ue040\ue034\ue026\ue03e \ue017\ue14a  \ue02e\ue058\ue026\ue047 \ue0c9\ue030 \ue030\ue07c \ue0ab\ue031\ue037\ue0a7\ue0ae\ue027\ue026 \n\ue017\ue0bd\ue03f\ue01e\ue011 : \n  (i) 2- \ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-2-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 1-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047\ue02c\ue047\ue09e\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047\ue02c\ue047\ue09e\ue021\ue047\ue02a \n  (ii) 1- \ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-3-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-2-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a, 2-\ue0d2\ue03e\ue047\ue030\ue03e\ue047-3-\ue030\ue047\ue03f\ue027\ue034\ue0a2\ue031\ue042\ue021\ue047\ue02a 2 \uf0b4 1",

In zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as \nthey react both with acids and bases. \n On the basis of their molecular shape, proteins are classified into two \ntypes : Fibrous and Globular proteins. Structure and shape of proteins can \nbe studied at four different levels i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and \nquaternary, each level being more complex than the previous one. The \nsecondary or tertiary structure of proteins get disturbed on change of pH \nor temperature and they are not able to perform their functions. This is \ncalled denaturation of proteins.          \n Answer the following questions :        \n (a) What are essential amino acids ?  1 \n (b) What is meant by zwitter ionic form of amino acids ? 1 \n (c) (i) Give one example each for Fibrous protein and Globular \nprotein.  \n  (ii) What type of linkages hold monomers of proteins together ? 21=2 \n                                             OR  \n (c) (i) What is the structural feature which characterises a reducing \nsugar ?   \n  (ii) What is the structural difference between nucleoside and \nnucleotide  ? 21=2 \n56/3/1-13 23 P.T.O. \nSECTION E",

Strictly speaking, \nthis condition is fulfilled only in exceptional cases for mixtures (optical \nisomers, isotopic mixtures of an element, hydrocarbon mixtures). It is \nstill usual to talk about ideal solutions as limiting cases in reality since \nvery dilute solutions behave ideally with respect to the solvent. This view \nis further supported by the fact that Raoult\u2019s law empirically found for \ndescribing the behaviour of the solvent in dilute solutions can be deduced \nthermodynamically via the assumption of ideal behaviour of the solvent.  \n Answer the following questions :      \n (a) Give one example of miscible liquid pair which shows negative \ndeviation from Raoult\u2019s law.

          "text": "Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones that represent \nenormous structural diversity in terms of the arrangement of atoms in \nspace, resulting in hundreds of stereoisomers. Although the chemical \nproperties of most stereoisomers may not be very different, their \nmetabolic rate and utilization in biological systems is significantly \ndifferent and known to influence the overall carbohydrate metabolism. \nStructural variants, which arise due to a different arrangement of atoms \nin three -dimensional space are known as stereoisomers. The number of \nstereoisomers can be theoretically estimated by using the formula 2n, \nwhere \u2018n\u2019 is the number of stereocenters or asymmetric (chiral) carbon \natoms in a molecule. Out of these stereoisomers, there are some \nstructures, which are mirror images of each other, and they are referred \nto as enantiomers.  \n Answer the following questions :      \n (a) Give chemical reactions to show the presence of an aldehydic group \nand straight chain in glucose.  2 \n (b) (i) Define anomers.  1 \n   OR \n (b) (ii) Draw the structure of \uf062-D-Glucopyranose.  1 \n (c) Sucrose is known as invert sugar.

It must be remembered that this \ntheory was put forward before the electron had been discovered by  \nJ.J. Thomson in 1897, and before the electronic theory of valency. Werner \ndid not have any of the modern instrumental techniques and all his \nstudies were made using simple experimental techniques. Werner was \nable to explain the nature of bonding in complexes and he concluded that \nin complexes, the metal shows two different sorts of valency : primary \nand secondary. Primary valences are normally ionisable whereas \nsecondary valences are non ionisable.  \n Answer the following questions :      \n (a) One mole of CrCl3 . 4H2O precipitates one mole of AgCl when \ntreated with excess of AgNO3 solution.

          "text": "Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones that represent \nenormous structural diversity in terms of the arrangement of atoms in \nspace, resulting in hundreds of stereoisomers. Although the chemical \nproperties of most stereoisomers may not be very different, their \nmetabolic rate and utilization in biological systems is significantly \ndifferent and known to influence the overall carbohydrate metabolism. \nStructural variants, which arise due to a different arrangement of atoms \nin three -dimensional space are known as stereoisomers. The number of \nstereoisomers can be theoretically estimated by using the formula 2n, \nwhere \u2018n\u2019 is the number of stereocenters or asymmetric (chiral) carbon \natoms in a molecule. Out of these stereoisomers, there are some \nstructures, which are mirror images of each other, and they are referred \nto as enantiomers.  \n Answer the following questions :      \n (a) Give chemical reactions to show the presence of an aldehydic group \nand straight chain in glucose.  2 \n (b) (i) Define anomers.  1 \n   OR \n (b) (ii) Draw the structure of \uf062-D-Glucopyranose.  1 \n (c) Sucrose is known as invert sugar.

          "text": "Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones that represent \nenormous structural diversity in terms of the arrangement of atoms in \nspace, resulting in hundreds of stereoisomers. Although the chemical \nproperties of most stereoisomers may not be very different, their \nmetabolic rate and utilization in biological systems is significantly \ndifferent and known to influence the overall carbohydrate metabolism. \nStructural variants, which arise due to a different arrangement of atoms \nin three -dimensional space are known as stereoisomers. The number of \nstereoisomers can be theoretically estimated by using the formula 2n, \nwhere \u2018n\u2019 is the number of stereocenters or asymmetric (chiral) carbon \natoms in a molecule. Out of these stereoisomers, there are some \nstructures, which are mirror images of each other, and they are referred \nto as enantiomers.  \n Answer the following questions :      \n (a) Give chemical reactions to show the presence of an aldehydic group \nand straight chain in glucose.  2 \n (b) (i) Define anomers.  1 \n   OR \n (b) (ii) Draw the structure of \uf062-D-Glucopyranose.  1 \n (c) Sucrose is known as invert sugar.

          "text": "Werner\u2019s coordination theory in 1893 was the first attempt to explain the \nbonding in coordination complexes. It must be remembered that this \ntheory was put forward before the electron had been discovered by  \nJ.J. Thomson in 1897, and before the electronic theory of valency.

          "text": "Amines are usually formed from amides, imides , halides, nitro \ncompounds, etc. They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influences their \nphysical properties. In alkyl amines, a combination of electron releasing, \nsteric and H -bonding factors influence the stability of the substituted \nammonium cations in protic polar solvents and thus affect the basic \nnature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger bases than \nammonia. Amines being basic in nature, react with acids to form salts. \nAryldiazonium salts, undergo replacement of the diazonium group with a \nvariety of nucleophiles to produce aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and \narenes.     \n Answer the following questions :      \n (a) How can you convert the following ?  2 \n  (i) Ethanoic acid to m ethanamine  \n  (ii) Prop anen itrile  to 1-aminopropane   \n (b) Why is pKb value of aniline more than that of methylamine ?   1 \n(c) (i) Arrange the following in increasing order of their basic \nstrength in aqueous solution :  1 \n   CH3 \u2013 NH2,   (CH3)2NH,   (CH3)3N  \n   OR \n(c) (ii) Give the structures of A and B in the following reaction :  1 \n  C6H5NO2  \n\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af \u2192Fe/HCl  A  \n\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af \u21922HNO\n273 K   B",

In alkyl amines, a combination of electron releasing, \nsteric and H -bonding factors influence the stability of the substituted \nammonium cations in protic polar solvents and thus affect the basic \nnature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger bases than \nammonia. Amines being basic in nature, react with acids to form salts. \nAryldiazonium salts, undergo replacement of the diazonium group with a \nvariety of nucleophiles to produce aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and \narenes.     \n Answer the following questions :      \n (a) How can you convert the following ?  2 \n  (i) Ethanoic acid to m ethanamine  \n  (ii) Prop anen itrile  to 1-aminopropane   \n (b) Why is pKb value of aniline more than that of methylamine ?   1 \n(c) (i) Arrange the following in increasing order of their basic \nstrength in aqueous solution :  1 \n   CH3 \u2013 NH2,   (CH3)2NH,   (CH3)3N  \n   OR \n(c) (ii) Give the structures of A and B in the following reaction :  1 \n  C6H5NO2  \n\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af \u2192Fe/HCl  A  \n\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af \u21922HNO\n273 K   B  \nSECTION  E",
