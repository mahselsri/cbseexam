Junction Diode as a Rectifier :  \n The process of conversion of an ac voltage into a dc voltage is called \nrectification and the device which performs this conversion is called a \nrectifier. The characteristics of a p-n junction diode reveal that when a  \np-n junction diode is forward biased, it offers a low resistance and when it \nis reverse biased, it offers a high resistance. Hence, a p-n junction diode \nconducts only when it is forward biased. This property of a p-n junction \ndiode makes it suitable for its use as a rectifier. \n Thus, when an ac voltage is applied across a p-n junction, it conducts \nonly during those alternate half cycles for which it is forward biased. A \nrectifier which rectifies only half cycle of an ac voltage is called a  \nhalf-wave rectifier and one that rectifies both the half cycles is known as  \na full-wave rectifier.  \n(i) The root mean square value of an alternating voltage applied to a \nfull-wave rectifier is \n2V0. Then the root mean square value of the \nrectified output voltage is : 1 \n(A) \n2V0 (B) \n2V2\n0 \n(C) \n2V20 (D) \n22V0 \n(ii) In a full-wave rectifier, the current in each of the diodes flows for : 1 \n(A) Complete cycle of the input signal \n(B) Half cycle of the input signal \n(C) Less than half cycle of the input signal \n(D) Only for the positive half cycle of the input signal \n(iii) In a full-wave rectifier : 1 \n(A) Both diodes are forward biased at the same time. \n(B) Both diodes are reverse biased at the same time. \n(C) One is forward biased and the other is reverse biased at the \nsame time. \n(D) Both are forward biased in the first half of the cycle and \nreverse biased in the second half of the cycle. \n11- (iv) (a) An alternating voltage of frequency of 50 Hz is applied to a \nhalf-wave rectifier. Then the ripple frequency of the output \nwill be : 1 \n(A) 100 Hz (B) 50 Hz \n(C) 25 Hz  (D) 150 Hz \n  OR \n (b) A signal, as shown in the figure, is applied to a p-n junction \ndiode.

          "text": "Junction Diode as a Rectifier :  \n The process of conversion of an ac voltage into a dc voltage is called \nrectification and the device which performs this conversion is called a \nrectifier. The characteristics of a p-n junction diode reveal that when a  \np-n junction diode is forward biased, it offers a low resistance and when it \nis reverse biased, it offers a high resistance. Hence, a p-n junction diode \nconducts only when it is forward biased. This property of a p-n junction \ndiode makes it suitable for its use as a rectifier. \n Thus, when an ac voltage is applied across a p-n junction, it conducts \nonly during those alternate half cycles for which it is forward biased. A \nrectifier which rectifies only half cycle of an ac voltage is called a  \nhalf-wave rectifier and one that rectifies both the half cycles is known as \na full-wave rectifier.   \n11-55/1/2 17 P.T.O.

Junction Diode as a Rectifier :  \n The process of conversion of an ac voltage into a dc voltage is called \nrectification and the device which performs this conversion is called a \nrectifier. The characteristics of a p-n junction diode reveal that when a  \np-n junction diode is forward biased, it offers a low resistance and when it \nis reverse biased, it offers a high resistance. Hence, a p-n junction diode \nconducts only when it is forward biased. This property of a p-n junction \ndiode makes it suitable for its use as a rectifier. \n Thus, when an ac voltage is applied across a p-n junction, it conducts \nonly during those alternate half cycles for which it is forward biased. A \nrectifier which rectifies only half cycle of an ac voltage is called a  \nhalf-wave rectifier and one that rectifies both the half cycles is known as  \na full-wave rectifier.  \n(i) The root mean square value of an alternating voltage applied to a \nfull-wave rectifier is \n2V0. Then the root mean square value of the \nrectified output voltage is : 1 \n(A) \n2V0 (B) \n2V2\n0 \n(C) \n2V20 (D) \n22V0 \n(ii) In a full-wave rectifier, the current in each of the diodes flows for : 1 \n(A) Complete cycle of the input signal \n(B) Half cycle of the input signal \n(C) Less than half cycle of the input signal \n(D) Only for the positive half cycle of the input signal \n(iii) In a full-wave rectifier : 1 \n(A) Both diodes are forward biased at the same time. \n(B) Both diodes are reverse biased at the same time. \n(C) One is forward biased and the other is reverse biased at the \nsame time. \n(D) Both are forward biased in the first half of the cycle and \nreverse biased in the second half of the cycle. \n11-55/1/3 21 P.T.O.

It depends upon the nature of the electrolyte, the area of the \nelectrodes immersed in the electrolyte and the temperature. Due to \ninternal resistance, a part of the energy supplied by the cell is wasted in \nthe form of heat.  \n When no current is drawn from the cell, the potential difference between \nthe two electrodes in known as emf of the cell ( ).

A small resistance, called shunt, of a \nsuitable value is connected with the galvanometer to convert it into an \nammeter of desired range. By using a higher resistance, a galvanometer \ncan also be converted into a voltmeter. \n(i) The value of the current sensitivity of a galvanometer is given by : 1 \n(A)    (B)   \n(C)    (D)  \n(ii) A galvanometer of resistance 6  shows full scale deflection for a \ncurrent of 0\u00b72 A.

The ratio  is a constant,  \ndenoted by C and is called the capacitance of the capacitor. It is \nindependent of Q or V. It depends only on the geometrical configuration \n(shape, size, separation) of the two conductors and the medium \nseparating the conductors. When a parallel plate capacitor is charged, the \nelectric field E0 is localised between the plates and is uniform \nthroughout. When a slab of a dielectric is inserted between the charged \nplates (charge density ), the dielectric is polarised by the field. \nConsequently opposite charges appear on the faces of the slab, near the \nplates, with surface charge density of magnitude p. For a linear \ndielectric p is proportional to E0. Introduction of a dielectric changes the \nelectric field, and hence, the capacitance of a capacitor, and hence, the \nenergy stored in the capacitor. \n Like resistors, capacitors can also be arranged in series or in parallel or \nin a combination of series and parallel.      \n(i) Consider a capacitor of capacitance C, with plate area A and plate \nseparation d, filled with air [Fig. (a)].

It depends only on the geometrical configuration \n(shape, size, separation) of the two conductors and the medium \nseparating the conductors. When a parallel plate capacitor is charged, the \nelectric field E0 is localised between the plates and is uniform \nthroughout. When a slab of a dielectric is inserted between the charged \nplates (charge density ), the dielectric is polarised by the field. \nConsequently opposite charges appear on the faces of the slab, near the \nplates, with surface charge density of magnitude p.

There are two type of dopants \nused in doping, Si or Ge, and using  them p-type and n-type \nsemiconductors can be obtained. A p-n junction is the basic building block \nof many semiconductor devices. Two important processes occur during \nthe formation of a p-n junction : diffusion and drift. When such a junction \n-cores. \nThis is responsible for a junction potential barrier. The width of a \ndepletion layer and the height of potential barrier changes when a \njunction is forward-biased or reverse-biased. A semiconductor diode is \nbasically a p-n junction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for \napplication of an external voltage. Using diodes, alternating voltages can \nbe rectified.         \n(i) (a) In reverse-biased p-n junction :  1 \n(A) the drift current is of the order of few mA.  \n(B) the applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion \nregion. \n(C) the depletion region width decreases.   \n(D) the current increases with increase in applied voltage. \n  OR \n (b) The output frequency of a full-wave rectifier with 50 Hz as \ninput frequency is :  1 \n(A) 25 Hz  (B) 50 Hz  \n(C) 100 Hz  (D) 200 Hz  \n  (ii) During formation of a p-n junction :   1 \n(A) a layer of negative charge on n-side and a layer of positive \ncharge on p-side appear.  \n(B) a layer of positive charge on n-side and a layer of negative \ncharge on p-side appear. \n(C) the electrons on p-side of the junction move to n-side \ninitially. \n(D) initially diffusion current is small and drift current is large. \n  # \n   55/6/3 Page 26  of 31       \n(iii) Si\n 1 \n(A) 0 5 eV   (B) 0 1 eV \n(C) 0 05 eV   (D) 0 01 eV \n(iv) -Ge ? 1 \n(A)    (B)  \n(C)    (D)",

          "text": "When light travels from an optically denser medium to an optically rarer \nmedium, at the interface it is partly reflected back into the same medium \nand partly refracted to the second medium. The angle of incidence \ncorresponding to an angle of refraction 90  is called the critical angle (ic) \nfor the given pair of media. This angle is related to the refractive index of \nmedium 1 with respect to medium 2.  \n Refraction of light through a prism involves refraction at two plane \ninterfaces. A relation for the refractive index of the material of the prism \ncan be obtained in terms of the refracting angle of the prism and the \nangle of minimum deviation. For a thin prism, this relation reduces to a \nsimple equation.  \n Laws of refraction are also valid for refraction of light at a spherical \ninterface. When an object is placed in front of a spherical surface \nseparating two media, its image is formed. A relation between object and \nimage distance, in terms of refractive indices of two media and the radius \nof curvature of the spherical surface can be obtained. Using this relation \n(i) A small bulb is placed at the bottom of a tank containing a \ntransparent liquid (refractive index n) to a depth H.

If we consider \nall the electrons, their average velocity will be zero. When an electric field \nis applied, electrons move with an average velocity, known as drift \nvelocity (vd). The average time between successive collisions is known as \nrelaxation time ( ). The magnitude of drift velocity per unit electric field \nis called mobility ( ). \n An expression for current through the conductor can be obtained in terms \nof drift velocity, number of electrons per unit volume (n), electronic \ncharge (  e), and the cross-sectional area (A) of the conductor. This \nexpression leads to an expression between current density ( ) and the \nelectric field ( ). Hence, an expression for resistivity ( ) of a metal is \nobtained. This expression helps us to understand increase in resistivity of \na metal with increase in its temperature, in terms of change in the \nrelaxation time ( ) and change in the number density of electrons (n). \n(i) Consider two cylindrical conductors A and B, made of the same \nmetal connected in series to a battery.

          "text": "When light travels from an optically denser medium to an optically rarer \nmedium, at the interface it is partly reflected back into the same medium \nand partly refracted to the second medium. The angle of incidence \ncorresponding to an angle of refraction 90  is called the critical angle (ic) \nfor the given pair of media. This angle is related to the refractive index of \nmedium 1 with respect to medium 2.  \n Refraction of light through a prism involves refraction at two plane \ninterfaces. A relation for the refractive index of the material of the prism \ncan be obtained in terms of the refracting angle of the prism and the \nangle of minimum deviation. For a thin prism, this relation reduces to a \nsimple equation.  \n Laws of refraction are also valid for refraction of light at a spherical \ninterface. When an object is placed in front of a spherical surface \nseparating two media, its image is formed. A relation between object and \nimage distance, in terms of refractive indices of two media and the radius \nof curvature of the spherical surface can be obtained. Using this relation \n(i) An object is placed in front of a convex spherical glass surface  \n(n = 1\u00b75 and radius of curvature R) at a distance of 4R from it. As \nthe object is moved slowly close to the surface, the image formed is : 1 \n(A) always real \n(B) always virtual \n(C) first real and then virtual  \n(D) first virtual and then real \n(ii) A double-convex lens, made of glass of refractive index 1\u00b75, has \nfocal length 10 cm. The radius of curvature of its each face, is :  1 \n(A) 10 cm  (B) 15 cm \n(C) 20 cm   (D) 40 cm \n  # \n   55/7/3 Page 24  of 31  \n(iii) H n\nR,  1 \n(A)    \n(B)  \n(C)    \n(D)  \n(iv)   60\n30\n 1 \n(A) 1\u00b73 (B) 1\u00b74 \n(C) 1\u00b75 (D) 1\u00b76 \n (n = 1\u00b752)\nDm\n(n = 1\u00b762) ,\n : 1 \n(A) 4%   (B) 4%  \n(C) 19%  (D) 19%  \n  # \n   55/7/3 Page 25  of 31 P.T.O.      \n(iii) A small bulb is placed at the bottom of a tank containing a \ntransparent liquid (refractive index n) to a depth H.
